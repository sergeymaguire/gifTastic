This is fun to use if you are bored and want to look up some awesome gifs!!  This was the first program I wrote using ajax calls and an API.  This returns 10 gifs from whatever you search and adds it as a button to the top of the page which can also be used to return more gifs.  There are also default buttons you can click on that will add 10 gifs below,  I also set the rating limit to R because thats where all the funny ones are the PG ones are super lame and the people who will be viewing this will be older then 10 haha.  You can also pause and play the gifs at your own will!  I do not have the nicest layout and wish I had spent more time on it but it is fully functional and does not have any bugs that I am aware of.  Go ahead I know you want some giphy awesomeness!!!!!!!
